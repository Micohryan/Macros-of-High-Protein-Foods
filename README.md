# Macros-of-High-Protein-Foods

One of my passions outside of data analysis and coding is working out. While working out, you have to keep track of your diet and make sure you eat enough protein in order to allow your muscles to recover and grow. I was wondering what foods had the highest protein content and if I could find foods that I didn't know had high protein content into my diet. 

## Data Source

I looked on Kaggle to find any data sources that could help answer my question. The data source I found here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fydrose/macros-of-popular-high-protein-foods?select=macros_dataset.csv

## Content
The dataset was pretty new being published around November. The author obtained the data through cross-referencing blogs and lists for high protein foods and then finding the macro content or Fats, Protein, and Carb content for each food. The dataset contains 60 rows and 8 different attributes.

## Attributes in dataset

* food_name
* proteins_100g
* carbohydrates_100g
* fat_100g
* energy_100g
* category_name
* origin
* diet_type

## Questions

1. Which foods had the highest protein content?
2. Which foods have the highest protein to calorie ratio?
3. Are there any significant difference between Macros and Calories between Diet Types
4. What are the top foods that have the highest percentage of their calories made up of protein.
